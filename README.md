# guessmynumber
Welcome to my first python project!
This is a number guessing game where the programs generates a random number between 1 - 10 and the 
user has to guess the number in three attempts. 
Features:
-Programs generates a random number every time
-If the player's guess is incorrect, the program gives player hints for instance - the number is higher 
 than your guess, or your number is lower than your guess, etc.
- When the player wins or loses, the game asks the player if they want to play again and takes input y/n to restart.
- If the player inputs a different data format than the ones the program accepts(int), program will throw an error
  and ask player to input again.
